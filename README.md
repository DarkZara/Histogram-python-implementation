image processing : image histogram implementation with python from scratch

Histogram is a basic but important tool for image processing (and sosmetimes even image classification or computer vision), in this note book i have implemented image histogram calculation from scratch using only numpy.

at the end the result of cv2.histogram and mine are presented using matplot.

hope you like it.
